# hardware-ecosystem-prototype
A blend of chips for taking on complex computing tasks. 
This is a design I came up with two years ago as I started putting all this data and research together. I knew these computations would require more than just a CPU and a GPU combination. The Silicon Antimony atoms chip can do the same computations as the Silicon Photonics Chip, they would just use different languages and techniques on their own hardware/sofware comaptibility. A NPU chip would run in the middle of either or as a orchastrator/translator. Then the data is returned back to the CPU&GPU combo for the users end result. This archetecture is a big consideration for a quality chip ecosytem that will compliment our Frankenstien project. Stay tuned. Its still a protype design but feedback is welcomed.
